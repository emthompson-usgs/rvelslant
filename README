This is some code I wrote for a project in grad school many years ago.
I have not maintained the code, but I have received some requests to
use it. So I am putting it on github and making minimal changes so that
it will run.

This code was described in
[USGS OFR 2007-1124](https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2007/1124/).
I would not be shocked some of the descriptions are out of date.
